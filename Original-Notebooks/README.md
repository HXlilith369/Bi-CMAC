1.Statement: We provide the random seeds to facilitate reproducibility; however, our initial version of the code may contain bugs that could cause fluctuations in the paper's results.

2.In the Acc7 setting, the computation of MAE (Mean Absolute Error) and Corr (Pearson Correlation) is not fully accurate due to the discretization of labels. Therefore, these results are not reported in the main text and are provided for reference only.
